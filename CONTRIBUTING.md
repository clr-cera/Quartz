# How can you contribute to Quartz?
### Bugs?
If you have found a bug, I would be very thankful if you could open an issue describing the problem, or, if you know to how solve it, open a pr!

You should describe your problem as much as possible, if given a solution, please try to explain it.

### New Feature?
If you have an idea for a new feature feel free to pr it!

Please explain what you intend to create and describe the reason why it is valuable or interesting.

### Documentation
If you found any hole on documentation you are completely invited to expose it in an issue or contribute on extending it!

Please try to maintain consistency with existing documentation but there is no strictness.

## Coding Convention,
If you are adding code with a pr, please be sure it follows the black python formatter and to add comments describing new functions, classes or anything else you feel it is fair to document!

# Thanks for contributing!
